# weather-app

This is a weather app create with vanilla JS

[DONE] Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
[DONE] Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
[DONE] Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
[DONE] Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
[] Display the information on your webpage!
[] Add any styling you like!
[] Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
[] Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
